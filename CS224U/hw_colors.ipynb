That notebook provides backgroud on the task, the dataset, and the modeling code that you will be using and adapting.\n","\n","The homework questions are more open-ended than previous ones have been. Rather than asking you to implement pre-defined functionality, they ask you to try to improve baseline components of the full system in ways that you find to be effective. As usual, this culminates in a prompt asking you to develop a novel system for entry into the bake-off. In this case, though, the work you do for the homework will likely be directly incorporated into that system (not required, but an efficient way to work at the very least)."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"eMlrn-Ouo1e-"},"source":["## Set-up"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"mhyZ3xRgo1fA"},"source":["See [colors_overview.ipynb](colors_overview.ipynb) for set-up in instructions and other background details."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"43VDQThco1fB"},"outputs":[],"source":["from colors import ColorsCorpusReader\n","from nltk.translate.bleu_score import corpus_bleu\n","import numpy as np\n","import os\n","import pandas as pd\n","from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\n","from torch_color_describer import ContextualColorDescriber\n","from torch_color_describer import create_example_dataset\n","\n","import utils\n","from utils import START_SYMBOL, END_SYMBOL, UNK_SYMBOL"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"roRqnwvro1fD"},"outputs":[],"source":["utils.fix_random_seeds()"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"RnPmpCDjo1fE"},"outputs":[],"source":["COLORS_SRC_FILENAME = os.path.join(\n","    \"data\", \"colors\", \"filteredCorpus.csv\")"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"2Bm2r7Dbo1fG"},"source":["## All two-word examples as a dev corpus\n","\n","So that you don't have to sit through excessively long training runs during development, I suggest working with the two-word-only subset of the corpus until you enter into the late stages of system testing."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"mR_i4skUo1fH"},"outputs":[],"source":["dev_corpus = ColorsCorpusReader(\n","    COLORS_SRC_FILENAME,\n","    word_count=2,\n","    normalize_colors=True)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"yV6-9VbVo1fI"},"outputs":[],"source":["dev_examples = list(dev_corpus.read())"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"Oc_86zOqo1fI"},"source":["This subset has about one-third the examples of the full corpus:"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"F0FNF-_co1fK","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1642576622468,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":5,"user":{"displayName":"Gal Kampel","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/default-user=s64","userId":"13734932312114013687"}},"outputId":"8818de5c-de96-46b0-8efb-d2566fdc1d6e"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["13890"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":8}],"source":["len(dev_examples)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"rfITPf8_o1fL"},"source":["We __should__ worry that it's not a fully representative sample.

represent colors in a new way.\n","    \n","__Notes__:\n","\n","* You are not required to keep `represent_color`. This might be unnatural if you want to perform an operation on each color trio all at once.\n","* For that matter, if you want to process all of the color contexts in the entire data set all at once, that is fine too, as long as you can also perform the operation at test time with an unknown number of examples being tested.\n","\n","* The Fourier-transform method of [Monroe et al. 2016](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/D16-1243/) and [Monroe et al. 2017](https://transacl.org/ojs/index.php/tacl/article/view/1142) is a proven choice for our task. __It is not required that you implement this.__ However, if you decide to, you might find that the overly terse presentation in the paper is an obstacle. They key thing to see is that the notation $\\hat{f}_{jkl}$ is meant to specify a full coordinate system. Thus, you might do something like\n","\n","  ```\n","from itertools import product\n","for j, k, l in product((0, 1, 2), repeat=3):    \n","    f_jkl = ...\n","```\n","\n","  and collect these `f_jkl` values in a list of 27 values. Additionally, in Python, [`2j` produces a value with `real` and `imag` attributes](https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/cmath.html). Each element `f_jkl` should have these components. If you concatenate the `real` and `imag` parts of all the `f_jkl`, you will have a 54-dimensional representation, as in the paper. Remember to start with an HSV representation, and with $h$ in $[0, 360]$, $s$ in $[0, 200]$, and $v$ in $[0, 200]$ (or else do the scaling differently). Note that the values in our corpus are in HLS format, [which are easily converted to HSV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSL_and_HSV#HSL_to_HSV).\n","  \n","* It's natural to ask why this Fourier transform is useful in the current context. This is a challenging question, and I don't have a complete answer, but here is an intuitive observation: if you consider the raw color representations to be embeddings, then you can see very quickly that our standard geometric notions are totally out of line with our intuitions about the colors themselves. For example, here is a plot where we simply vary the hue dimension while keeping the other dimensions constant:\n","\n","  <img src=\"fig/colors-hue-hls.png\" alt=\"A series of very different colors with cosine distances from orange ranging from 0 to 0.19\" />\n","\n","  I've printed the cosine distances from the leftmost color above each patch. They all look pretty similar. Now, you might say, well at least the distances are sort of proportional to how different the colors are from the first. However, that argument seems to crumble when we do the same experiment but now varying the saturation dimension:\n","\n","  <img src=\"fig/colors-saturation-hls.png\" alt=\"A series of very similar purple-ish colors with cosine distances from gray-purple ranging from 0 to 0.19\" />\n","\n","  These colors are all quite simular intuitively. Notice, though, that the cosine distances are identical to my first plot. Of course! Cosine distances doesn't care about the nature of these dimensions! The underlying color space is a cylinder, not a regular Euclidean 3d space!\n","  \n","  The Fourier transformation that we apply is remapping the colors into approximately the cylindrical space that we want. It is at least capturing some the circular/radial relationships that are inherent in the space. Thus, here are plots corresponding to the above, but now where the colors have been transformed for the cosine comparisons. \n","  \n","  First, the hue variation:\n","  \n","  <img src=\"fig/colors-hue-fourier.png\" alt=\"A series of very different colors with cosine distances from orange that are generally large (near 1.0)\" />\n","\n","  And then saturation:\n","  \n","  <img src=\"fig/colors-saturation-fourier.png\" alt=\"A series of very similar purple-ish colors with cosine distances from gray purple that seem aligned with visual color similarity\" />\n","  \n","  These distances seem much better aligned with intuitions to me, and I think that's quite general. Thus, even if our networks can in principle learn this remapping, it's very helpful to at least start them closer to where we want them to be.\n","  \n","  If you want to go one layer deeper, then the [Zhang and Lu 2002](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S092359650200084X) paper that Monroe et al. 2016 cite is pretty intuitive. It's for the 2d case, but that actually makes the ideas somewhere more accessible, since they can easily plot the original and remapped feature spaces."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"9pTjZaPPo1fW"},"source":["The following test seeks to ensure only that the output of your `represent_color_context` will be compatible with the models we are creating:"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"_RTXGY9ro1fW"},"outputs":[],"source":["def test_represent_color_context(func):\n","    \"\"\"`func` should be `represent_color_context`\"\"\"\n","    example = [\n","        [0.786, 0.58, 0.87],\n","        [0.689, 0.44, 0.92],\n","        [0.628, 0.32, 0.81]]\n","    result = func(example)\n","    assert len(result) == len(example), \\\n","        (\"Color context representations need to represent each color \"\n","         \"separately.
